# fullstack

## Are you a candidate?

Are you a full-stack candidate? Take a look at the [take home assignment](./take-home.md).

## Background

Full-stack duties require ability to work in both the backend and frontend, and optionally skills in managing infrastructure (devops).

The assessment currently tests backend and frontend abilities by requiring the candidate to:

- read and understand the backend code in order to query it
- write a simple React app from scratch
- identify security issues

Note that the assessment does not cover any devops skills.

## How to assign

1. Host the api somewhere publicly accessible.
2. Provide the candidate with the api URL and [a link to the take home assignment](./take-home.md).
3. Make sure the candidate has access to the api source code.
